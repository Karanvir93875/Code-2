# Karanvir Singh - 8pm - 9:15 pm section - CS240-33
# Worked with Torendra Rasik from 6:30 - 7:45 Section
# Due Date : 5/17/18 
# Note: Program will run extremely slow if input exceeds 46.

				.data			# data declaration statement 
Input:			.asciiz "\nPlease enter a number that will output the corresponding Fibonacci Number: "
Output: 		.asciiz "\nThe Fibonacci number equivalent is: "
Exceeds46.Part1:.asciiz "\nInput is greater than 46; the program will take additonal time to get the Fibonacci Number."
Exceeds46.Part2:.asciiz "\nProgram will finish. Good luck!"
